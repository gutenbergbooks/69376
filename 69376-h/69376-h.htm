<p class="p2"><em>Question.</em> Why do you consider it a duty to preach and
publish abolition doctrines?</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> First, I consider it my duty as a Christian; for
the system of slavery, as a whole, and in each one of its
details, is in direct opposition to the precepts of the gospel.
Secondly, I consider it my duty as a conscientious
citizen of this republic; for I believe slavery is prejudicial
to the best interests of my country; and I dare
not hope that God’s blessing will rest upon us, if we
persevere in our iniquity.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But the abolitionists are accused of showing the
worst side of slavery. Is it not true that they seek to
give an exaggerated idea of its evils?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I believe every man, who candidly examines the
subject, will come to the conclusion, that every side
appears to be the worst side. Allow me to give a brief
statement of the case. Between two and three millions
of people are compelled to labor without wages. They
gain nothing more by working ten hours than they would
by working one hour. It is not in human nature that
they should be disposed to be industrious under these
circumstances. They try to do as little as possible. The
chief part of the labor that is got out of their bones and
sinews is obtained by fear of the whip. A peck of corn
a week is the usual allowance for the food of a slave.
The planters generally estimate that a slave can be fed
and clothed at an expense of from fifteen to twenty dollars
a year. The following is the printed testimony of Thomas
Clay, of Georgia, himself a slave-holder, though reputed
to be an amiable, conscientious man: “A peck of corn
per week, if it be sound flint corn, is sufficient to sustain
health and strength under moderate labor. But there is
<em>often</em> a defect in the quality, and the quantity is then insufficient.
The present economy of the slave system is
to get all you can from the slave, and give in return as
little as will barely support him in a working condition.
Even where there is not direct intention to abridge his
comforts, they are but little consulted; and the slave,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
seeing his master wholly engrossed by his own advantage,
naturally adopts the same selfish course, and, when not
restrained by higher principles, becomes deceitful and
selfish.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If Mr. Thomas Clay is a good man, and really
thinks slavery so bad in its effects, why does he not
emancipate his own slaves?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> If you were to ask him, I suppose he would give an
answer very common among planters. He would tell
you that he could not do it because the laws of the State
in which he lives impose such heavy penalties, that the
process of emancipation is extremely difficult and
expensive.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Who makes the laws of the Southern States?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The slave-holders themselves. When I hear a man
say that he would gladly emancipate his slaves, if the
<em>laws</em> would allow it, it makes me think of an anecdote I
have often heard. A little girl had been ordered to
perform some household work in the absence of her
mother. When the parent returned, and saw that her
orders had not been obeyed, she said, “My child, why
have you not done as I bid you?” The little girl replied,
“I should have been glad to do it, mother; but I could
not. Don’t you see I am tied?” “And pray who tied
you?” inquired the mother. “I tied myself,” was the
reply. Now this is plainly the case with the slave-holders.
They make oppressive laws, and persist in
upholding those laws, and then say, “I would do my
duty, if I could; but the <em>laws</em> will not permit it.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do the slaves have to work all the time?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> In some States the laws ordain that slaves shall
not be compelled to work <em>more</em> than <em>fourteen</em> hours a day,
from September to March, nor more than <em>fifteen</em> hours a
day, from March to September; and it is reasonable to
conclude that there would have been no necessity for
making such a law, unless some masters <em>did</em> compel
their slaves to toil beyond the specified hours. Convicts,
who are imprisoned for crime, are not obliged to work
more than ten hours a day, and are better fed than the
slaves. It is an extraordinary thing for a slave to be
sent to the state prison for an offence. Instead of punishment,
it would in fact be amelioration of his lot.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But I have been told that the slaves sometimes work
for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p><em>A.</em> When they happen to have kind masters, they are
sometimes allowed a part of the time to earn something
for themselves; but the laws are extremely inefficient
for the protection of property thus acquired. If a white
man sees fit to seize the products of their industry, the
law in most cases affords no redress; because in slave
States a colored man is never allowed to give evidence
against a white man, under any circumstances. Any
note of hand, or written contract with a slave is worth
no more than a promissory note to a dog; because no
slave can bring an action at law. In several of the
States, a slave is liable to punishment if it is ascertained
that he has acquired any property.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> I have been told that masters are allowed to kill
their slaves. Can this be true?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The laws do indeed nominally consider the killing
of a slave as murder; but no instance has ever been
recorded of a white man executed for killing a slave.
One law on this subject has the following strange qualification:
“Except said slave die of <em>moderate</em> punishment.”
As if any punishment, that occasioned death, <em>could</em> be
moderate! If a hundred blacks or mulattoes, either
bond or free, should see a slave murdered, it avails
nothing against the murderer; because the laws of slave
States do not allow a colored person, under any circumstances,
to testify against a white man. The laws of
South Carolina favor the master to such a degree,
that when accused of murdering a slave, he may be
absolved simply upon <em>his own oath</em>, that he did not commit
the crime!</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But I am told that white men are not unfrequently
prosecuted for cruelty to slaves; and this looks as if the
laws afforded the poor creatures some protection.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I have read not a few Reports of Cases in Southern
Courts; and those reports did more than any thing
else to make me an abolitionist. Prosecutions are
always brought for the master’s interest—never for the
protection or redress of the slave. In Martin’s Louisiana
Reports, 1818, you will find the case of Jourdan <em>vs.</em> Patten.
In this case a lady sued a neighboring proprietor for the
damage of putting out the only eye of one of her slaves.
The Supreme Court decided that the defendant should
pay the lady the sum of twelve hundred dollars; in consideration
of which, the slave should be placed in <em>his</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
possession. The lady received all the money, as an
indemnification for the loss of property; but the poor
slave not only received no atonement for his sufferings,
but was actually given to the very man that had knocked
his eye out! This is a fair sample of the nature of all
such prosecutions. In Nott &amp; McCord’s South Carolina
Reports, 1818, it is stated that a slave belonging to Mrs.
E. Witsell, was shot through the head by two men who
were hunting runaway negroes. The lady commenced
an action to recover the value of her slave. The judge
told the jury that circumstances <em>might</em> exist to authorize
the killing of a negro, <em>without the sanction of a magistrate,
or even the order of a militia officer</em>; but it was thought such
circumstances were not connected with <em>this</em> case; the
lady was therefore entitled to compensation for injury
done to her property. As for the poor slave himself, his
parents, his wife, or his children, they were never once
thought of in the matter.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But do you really believe they hunt negroes with
dogs and guns, as some people say?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> There cannot be the slightest doubt of the fact.
Dogs are trained for that express purpose. The planters
justify the practice, by saying it is absolutely necessary
for their own safety; because runaway negroes, who collect
in the woods and swamps, will soon begin to commit
depredations on the neighboring estates. Thus the
evils inevitably growing out of this bad system are
made use of to justify its cruelties. Free laborers would
have no inducement to run away and hide in swamps.
It would obviously be for their own interest to keep at
work. These negro hunts seem to be entered into with
all the keen excitement of sportsmen going out to hunt
squirrels or hares. A letter written near Edenton, N.C.
among other items of news, states: “We have had
great negro shooting lately.” A gentleman well known
in the literary world resided for some time in the family
of a Georgia planter; and he himself stated to me that
three negro hunts took place during the first nine months
of his stay there. He said, that one night hearing a
noise below stairs, he hastened to ascertain the cause.
“The gentlemen of the family were cleaning and loading
their guns, trying their flints, and going through the
usual preparations, apparently for a deer hunt, as buck
shot and bullets were in demand. The children of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
family had partaken of the general excitement, and arisen
from their beds. As I entered the room, I could
hear one of the youngest say, ‘Why, pa, you wouldn’t
kill Ralph, would you?’ ‘I would take him, and sell
him, and get money for him,’ said the next of age. ‘You
will only lame him, so as to seize him, I suppose,’ said
the mother. ‘I would rather kill him than the best fat
buck in the country,’ replied the father, as he rammed
down the heavy charge. The moonlight from the window
glanced along the barrel of the piece, and caught
the eye of the eldest boy. The reflected light kindled
up his glance with something of an unnatural flash, but
in vivid sympathy with the paternal look and attitude.
The anticipated joy of vengeance seemed to be the predominating
emotion.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> If the laws are as you say, I should think the
slaves did not stand a fair chance when they are <em>wrongfully</em>
accused.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> If you will examine Stroud’s Compendium of the
Slave Laws, you will be convinced for yourself that
what I say is true; and the effect is as you suppose.
The poor slaves are completely in the power of their
masters. The same men who accuse them are often
their judges and executioners. In illustration of this, I
will tell you a case that occurred in Edenton, North Carolina.
It was told by a woman who lived there at the
time, and witnessed some of the executions. Many of
the slaves in that place were skilful in mechanical
trades. The planters in the back country were very desirous
to purchase some of them; but their masters found
it so profitable to let them out, that they would not consent
to sell them. Those who were anxious to buy, hit
upon the following expedient to obtain their purpose:
They wrote anonymous letters, charging these intelligent
slaves with having projected an insurrection.
These letters were scattered about in Edenton, with the
idea that the masters would be glad to sell such dangerous
fellows; but instead of this, the poor innocent slaves
were tried, convicted, and sentenced by their frightened
owners; and a large number of them were put to death,
upon no other evidence than anonymous letters.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> It does not seem as if such things could take place
in a civilized country. Can you believe it?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> If you reflect a little upon human nature, I believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
you will think it perfectly natural that such abuses should
exist, wherever one human being has arbitrary power
over another. You would not like to place yourself
completely in the power even of the best man you know;
you would be afraid to have it depend entirely on his
will how much work you should do in a day, what food
you should eat, and what clothes you should wear, and
how and when you should be punished. It is not considered
entirely safe for an aged parent to relinquish all
his property, and trust entirely to the generosity of his
own children; what then do you suppose the poor slave
has to expect, when he becomes too old and infirm to be
profitable to his master?</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But the Southerners are said to be very honorable,
generous men.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Our Southern brethren are just what any human
beings would be under similar circumstances. They
are generous with the proceeds of other men’s labor, for
the same reason that the heir is prodigal of money, which
another accumulates for him. He who can let out his
neighbor, and his neighbor’s wife and children, and receive
all their wages, will naturally be more profuse
than a man who depends entirely on his own exertions.
Planters have heretofore generally confessed that slavery
is an evil, and many of them speak of its detailed
abuses with strong regret; but these abuses are merely
the necessary and inevitable results of the system they
are helping to support; and they never can cure the
abuses until they are willing to renounce the system itself.
I suppose that few planters would think of palliating
the treatment Mrs. Salarie’s slaves received; yet
they are all helping to support a system under which
such cruelties can be committed with impunity. Perhaps
very humane and amiable masters do even more
mischief than the desperately wicked; for they are always
quoted as palliations of the whole system; and
they approach so <em>near</em> to the right line, that they can
more easily draw over kind-hearted people, who have
not thought much upon the subject.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is the history of Mrs. Salarie?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> She resided in New Orleans. On the 10th of April,
1834, her splendid mansion took fire. During the midst
of the conflagration, a rumor arose among the crowd that
there were slaves chained in the burning dwelling; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
those who asked for the keys were reproved for interfering
with their neighbor’s business. At last the doors
were forced open by sailors and mechanics, that had
collected around the spot; and a New Orleans paper
thus describes the horrible scene that presented itself:
“Seven slaves more or less horribly mutilated, were
seen, some chained to the floor, and some suspended by
the neck to the ceiling, with their limbs stretched and
torn from one extremity to the other. Their bodies, from
head to foot, were covered with scars and sores, and
filled with wounds. One poor old man, upwards of sixty
years of age, was chained hand and foot, and made fast
to the floor, in a kneeling position. His head bore the
appearance of having been beaten until it was broken,
and the worms were actually seen making a feast of his
brains.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Every body must have thought her a very wicked
woman. Did the slave-holders in the neighborhood pretend
to justify her measures?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I have no doubt that every humane person, that
heard of the event, expressed horror, and sincerely felt
it. For several months previous to the discovery, her
neighbors had been in the habit of living in apartments
as far as possible from her house, on purpose to avoid
the shrieks and groans of her poor suffering slaves; yet
during all that time no complaint was laid before the
public authorities, and no investigation demanded! I
suppose neighbors were afraid to say any thing, lest they
should be accused of promoting discontent among the
negroes. Those who endeavor to keep human beings
in the situation of beasts, are more afraid of them than
they would be of beasts; because the human being has
<em>reason</em>, which is always prone to offer resistance to tyranny.
The consciousness of this makes slave-holders
very irritable when any one in the community takes part
with an abused slave, or expresses the slightest pity for
his sufferings.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is it not for the master’s interest to treat the slaves
well?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> So it is for the interest of men to treat their horses
and cattle well; and yet their passions not unfrequently
make them forget their interests. Passive obedience is
obtained from human beings with more difficulty than
from animals; and when the master <em>is</em> provoked, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
poor slave is completely in his power, with scarcely the
shadow of protection from the law. The law in no case
recognises slaves as human beings; on the contrary, it
expressly declares they “shall be deemed, sold, taken,
and reputed to be <em>chattels personal</em>, in the hands of their
owners and possessors, their administrators and assigns,
to all intents, constructions, and <em>purposes whatever</em>.”
An act of Maryland, for the settlement of estates, enumerates
specific articles, such as “slaves, working
beasts, animals,” &amp;c. Where even the <em>laws</em> consider human
beings as animals, it is not a matter of surprise that
they are generally treated no better than self-interest
leads men to treat animals. You will likewise perceive
that when the slave becomes old, or diseased, or in any
way unfit for labor, it is <em>not</em> for the interest of his master to
prolong his existence by rendering it comfortable. Then
again that part of the system connected with <em>overseers</em>,
shows plainly that the self-interest of the master cannot
effectually secure good treatment to the slave. If planters
were to give overseers a stated salary, without regard
to the amount of produce, the overseers (who are
proverbially unprincipled men) would have no motive
for consulting the interest of their employers—it would
be a matter of indifference to them whether much or little
work were done. To obviate this difficulty, it is customary
to give the overseer a certain <em>proportion</em> of the
profits of the plantation. Of course, it becomes his ruling
desire to get the greatest possible amount of work
done. He does not care how much the soil is exhausted,
nor how much the negroes are broken down. If a
slave says he is very ill, the overseer is unwilling to believe
the story, because he is reluctant to lose a day’s
labor. If the poor creature droops under his allotted
task, he must be stimulated by the whip, because the
overseer cannot spare an hour of his exertions. If the
“slave dies under <em>moderate</em> punishment,” the master
must furnish a new laborer; and the loss falls on <em>him</em>,
not on the overseer. It is obviously natural for the latter
personage to think more of his own gains than of his
employer’s losses. Every body knows that men are
prone to drive hired horses with less mercy than their
own; because they do not meet with any personal loss
from injury done to the beast, and their object is to get
their money’s worth of riding. Is it not a fearful thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
for one human being to be placed towards another in the
same relation that a stable-horse is toward the man who
hires him? When planters are reminded of instances of
cruelty, too well authenticated to be denied, they are
prone to lay the blame upon overseers. Mr. Wirt, of
Virginia, speaks of this class of men as “the lowest of
the human race—always cap in hand to the dons who
employ them, and furnishing materials for their pride,
insolence, and love of dominion.” If we had no such
information concerning the character of these men, we
should naturally conclude that good people would be
averse to enter into such an employment. Yet overseers
and drivers are a necessary part of this bad system, because
slaves are entirely deprived of the motives which
induce free laborers to work; and since overseers must
be employed, it is necessary to make it for their interest
to get as much work out of the slave as possible. The
evils of slavery are necessary and inevitable parts of the
system; and whether the planters reprobate them or not,
they cannot possibly avoid them, except by relinquishing
the system. The master and his subordinate agents
<em>must</em> have discretionary power to punish, because their
poor human brutes, being deprived of salutary motives
to exertion, must be driven to it. The slave <em>must</em> not be
allowed to buy or sell, or make the most trifling contracts;
because the oppressed being would naturally
avail himself of this privilege, and sell some of the cotton
or tobacco, which he cultivates for his master without
wages. The laws <em>must</em> punish them with great severity;
because the very nature of their condition is a
constant temptation to theft, falsehood, and murder.
They <em>must</em> be kept brutally ignorant; because if they
were otherwise, they could not be kept in slavery.
Licentiousness <em>must</em> be countenanced among them; because
their master’s interest is connected with their increase,
and he might lose many good bargains if the laws
did not allow him to sell a wife from her husband, or a husband
from his wife. The law <em>must</em> suppose a negro to be
a slave, till he proves himself free; because runaway
slaves would of course pretend that they were free.
They <em>must</em> not be allowed to witness against a white
man; for a slave may have had a wife or a child whipped
to death by a white man—and he may have many other
good reasons for strong prejudice against white men.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
An unnatural system <em>must</em> be sustained by unnatural
means. Hence we find the same characteristic features
in every country where negro slavery has been
allowed.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Some people think slavery as great a sin as the
slave trade. Are you of that opinion?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> There seems to me just the same difference as
there is between the thief and the man who pays him for
stealing. What would you say of a man who buys a
horse, knowing it to be stolen? The following circumstance,
which took place a short time before our Revolution,
furnishes a good commentary on this matter. A
Philadelphia negro was accused of having stolen goods
in his possession. He acknowledged the fact, saying,
“Massa Justice, me know me got dem tings from Tom
dere, and me tink Tom teal dem too; but what den,
Massa? dey be only a piccaninny knife, and a piccaninny
corkscrew; one cost sixpence, and tudder a shilling; an
me <em>pay Tom honestly for dem</em>, Massa.” “Pretty story,
truly!” said his worship; “you knew they were stolen,
and yet allege for excuse, you honestly paid for them.
Don’t you know, Pompey, that the receiver is as bad as
the thief? You must be severely whipped, you black
rascal.” “Very well, Massa, if de black rascal be whipt
for buying tolen goods, me hope de white rascal be
whipt too, for same ting, when you catch him.” “To
be sure,” replied the Justice. “Well den,” says Pompey,
“here be Tom’s Massa—hold him fast, constable!
He buy Tom, as I buy de piccaninny knife, and de piccaninny
corkscrew. He know very well Tom be tolen
from his old fadder and mudder; de knife and de corkscrew
had neder.”</p>

<p>I do not see how we can escape from the conclusion
that the slave-owner is an accomplice of the slave-trader.
So long as a profitable market is kept open, the article
will be supplied, despite of difficulties and dangers.
The only way to stop the trade, is to shut up the market;
and this can be done only by the entire abolition of the
system of slavery. When nobody will buy a man, nobody
will be tempted to steal a man. Slavery never
exists without having more or less of the slave-trade
involved <em>in</em> it. There is in the very heart of our land a
slave-trade constantly carried on, and sanctioned by our
laws, which is as disgraceful and cruel as the foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
slave trade. The new slave States at the extreme South
have not slaves enough, and the climate, together with
the hard labor of the sugar plantations, kills them very
fast. The old slave States have a surplus of slaves,
which they send off to supply these markets. About
ten thousand are annually exported from Virginia alone.
Niles, in his Register, vol. 35, page 4, says: “Dealing
in slaves has become a <em>large</em> business. Establishments
are made at several places in Maryland and Virginia, at
which they are sold like cattle. These places are strongly
built, and well supplied with <em>thumbscrews</em>, <em>gags</em>, <em>cow-skins</em>,
<em>and other whips</em>, <em>often bloody</em>.” In these sales no
regard is paid to domestic ties. The newly married
wife is torn shrieking from her husband, and the mother
with her little ones are sold in “<em>separate</em> lots to suit purchasers.”
A gentleman in Charleston, S. C., writes to
his friend in New York: “Curiosity sometimes leads me
to the auction sales of the negroes. There I saw the
father looking with sullen contempt on the crowd, and
expressing an indignation in his countenance that he
dares not speak; and the mother pressing her infants
closer to her bosom, exclaiming, in wild and simple earnestness,
‘I can’t leff my children! I won’t leff my children!’
But the hammer went on, reckless whether it
united or sundered for ever. On another stand I saw a
man apparently as white as myself exposed for sale.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> I have heard some people say that the negroes do
not care so much about such separations as we should
suppose.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> There is no doubt that their degraded situation
tends to blunt the feelings, as well as to stultify the intellect;
and it is a fearful thing to think what Christians
have to answer for, who thus brutalize immortal souls.
But there are numerous instances to prove that the
poor creatures do often suffer the most agonizing sensations
when torn from those they love. Near Palmyra,
in Marion county, Missouri, two boys were sold to a
slave-trader, who did not intend to leave the place until
morning. During the night, the mother was kept chained
in an out-house, that she might not make any effort
to prevent the departure of her children. She managed
to get loose from her fetters, seized an axe, <ins class="corr" id="tn-13" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'cut off the the heads'">
cut off the heads</ins> of her sleeping boys, and then ended her own
life by the same instrument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>The Missouri Intelligencer, a few months ago, gave
an account of a slave named Michael, who was sold by
his master to Mr. J. E. Fenton, by whom he was to be
immediately shipped for the Southern markets. At the
mouth of the Ohio, he filed off his irons, and contrived
to escape. He immediately returned to the place where
his wife resided, and having armed himself, declared he
never would be sent to the South, unless his wife was allowed
to accompany him. He was finally taken by
stratagem, and lodged in jail for safe keeping. Finding
that his oppressors were determined to separate him
from his beloved wife, he committed suicide. I believe
the attachments of slaves are even stronger than ours;
for these ties constitute the only pleasure they are allowed
to have. Hundreds of instances might be told,
where they have preferred death to separation.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> I have been told they sometimes kidnapped free
colored persons, to sell them as slaves. Is it so?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is unquestionably true that this is carried on to
a considerable extent. More than twenty free colored
children were kidnapped in the single city of Philadelphia,
in 1825; and in 1827 two were stolen in open
day. It is a common thing to decoy the unsuspecting victims
on board a vessel, or to some retired spot, and then
seize and bind them. A New York paper of 1829, says:
“Beware of kidnappers! It is well understood that there
is at present in this city, a gang of kidnappers, busily
engaged in their vocation of stealing colored children
for the Southern market.” As the law supposes every
colored person to be a slave unless he can <em>prove</em> himself
free, and as no person of his own complexion is allowed
to be evidence for him, the kidnappers have an easy
time of it.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Some people say we ought to pity the masters as
well as the slaves.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I agree with them entirely. The masters are to
be deeply pitied; because the long continuance of a
wicked system has involved them in difficulties, and at
the same time rendered them generally blind to the best
means of getting rid of those difficulties. They are likewise
to be compassionated for the effects which early
habits of power produce on their own characters. Mr.
Jefferson, who lived in the midst of slavery, says: “The
whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
exercise of the most boisterous passions; the most
unremitting despotism on the one part, and degrading
submission on the other. Our children see this, and
learn to imitate it. The parent storms; the child looks
on, catches the lineaments of wrath, puts on the same
airs in a circle of smaller slaves, gives loose to the worst
of passions; and thus nursed, educated, and daily
exercised in tyranny, cannot but be stamped by it with
odious peculiarities. The man must be a prodigy, who
can retain his morals and manners undepraved in such
circumstances.” The general licentiousness produced
by this system can never be described without using language
too gross to be addressed to a civilized community.
Some idea of it may be derived from the fact,
that every female slave is completely in the power of her
master, of his sons, of his overseers, and his drivers.
The law does not allow her to offer resistance to a white
man, under any circumstances; and the state of public
opinion is such that any pretensions to virtue on her part
would be treated with brutal ridicule. The slave is not
allowed to have any right in his wife and children. If
his master’s interest can be served by his keeping three
or four wives, or by his wife’s having a succession of
husbands, he cannot dispute the commands of his owner.
<ins class="corr" id="tn-15" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Ths wife, or the'">
The wife, or the</ins> husband, is sometimes sold, and sent
thousands of miles from each other, and from their little
ones, without the slightest hope of ever meeting again.
Under these circumstances, the man, or the woman, is
soon ordered to take another partner; because it is for
the interest of the master that they should do so. It is a
shameful fact that the laws and customs of our country
make it absolutely impossible for a large portion of our
population to be virtuous, even if they wish to be so.
The wealth of Virginia is principally made by the breeding
of slaves and horses; and persons unaccustomed to
the system would be shocked by the detail of well authenticated
facts, which prove that about as little regard
is paid to decency in one case as the other. <em>Mulatto</em>
slaves bring a higher price than <em>black</em> ones; hence licentiousness
in slave States becomes a profitable vice,
instead of being expensive, as it is under other forms of
society.</p>

<p><em>Q</em>. I have been told that a great many of the slaves
have very light complexions. Is it so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p><em>A.</em> In the old slave States, where the process of <ins class="corr" id="tn-16" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'amagamation has been'">
amalgamation has been</ins> going on for a long time, this is remarkably
the case. An old soldier, who lately visited
the South, said he was not so much struck by any circumstance,
as by the great change that had taken place
in the complexion of the slaves since the Revolution.
Now and then I have seen in the southern papers advertisements
for a runaway slave, “who passes himself
for a white man.” A Boston gentleman, who dislikes
the abolitionists very much, visited Georgia a few years
ago. He told me that when he was walking with a planter
one day, they met a man driving a team, who had a
perfectly fair complexion, with blue eyes and brown hair.
The Bostonian remarked, “That must be an independent
fellow, to be driving a team in this part of the country,
where it is considered so disgraceful for a white
man to work.” “O, that fellow is a slave,” replied
the Georgian. Almost every body has heard of the recent
case of Mary Gilmore, of Philadelphia, a perfectly
white girl, of Irish parentage, who was taken up and
tried as a runaway slave. A Missouri newspaper proves
that a white man may, without a <em>mistake</em>, be adjudged a
slave. “A case of a slave sueing for his freedom, was
tried a few days since in Lincoln county, of which the
following is a brief statement of particulars: A youth of
about ten years of age sued for his freedom on the
ground that he was a free white person. The court
granted his petition to sue as a pauper upon inspection
of his person. Upon his trial before the jury, he was examined
by the jury and two learned physicians, all of
whom concurred in the opinion that very little, if any,
race of negro blood could be discovered by any of the
external appearances. All the physiological marks of
distinction, which characterize the African descent, had
disappeared. His skin was fair, his hair soft, straight,
fine and white, his eyes blue, but rather disposed to the
hazel-nut color; nose prominent, the lips small, his head
round and well formed, forehead high and prominent,
ears large, the tibia of the leg straight, and feet hollow.
Notwithstanding these evidences of his claims, he was
proved to be the descendant of a mulatto woman, and
that his progenitors on the mother’s side had been and
still were slaves: <em>consequently he was found to be a
slave</em>.” I have been told of a young physician, who went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
into the far Southern States to settle, and there became
in love with a very handsome and modest girl, who lived
at service. He married her; and about a year after that
event, a gentleman called at the house, and announced
himself as Mr. J*******y, of Mobile. He said to Dr.
W*****, “Sir, I have a trifling affair of business to settle
with you. You have married a slave of mine.” The
young physician resented this language; for he had not
entertained the slightest suspicion that the girl had any
other than white ancestors since the flood. But Mr. J.
furnished proofs of his claim, and Dr. W. knew very well
that the laws of the country would uphold him in it. After
considerable discussion, the best bargain he could
make was either to pay eight hundred dollars, or have
his wife put up at auction. He consented to the first
alternative, and his unwelcome visiter departed. When
he had gone, Dr. W. told his wife what had happened.
The poor woman burst into tears and said, “That as
Mr. J. <em>was her own father</em>, she had hoped that when he
heard she had found an honorable protector, he would
have left her in peace.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> There can be no doubt that slavery is a bad system;
but don’t you think it ought to be done away gradually?
Ought not the slaves to be fitted for freedom, before
they are emancipated?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The difficulty is, it is utterly impossible to fit them
for freedom while they remain slaves. The masters
know very well that their vassals will be servile just in
proportion as they are brutally ignorant; hence all their
legislation tends to keep them so. It is a disgraceful
fact, that in half of these United States the working
men are expressly forbidden to learn to read or write.
The law ordains that twenty lashes shall be inflicted
upon every slave found in an assembly met together for
the purpose of “mental instruction.” Any white person
who teaches a slave to read or write, or gives or
sells him any book (the Bible not excepted), is fined two
hundred dollars; and any colored person who commits
the same <em>crime</em>, is punished with thirty-nine lashes, or
with imprisonment. The Rev. Charles C. Jones, of
Georgia, said in one of his sermons: “Generally
speaking, the slaves appear to us to be without God and
without hope in the world—a <em>nation of heathen in our very
midst</em>. We cannot cry out against the Papists for withholding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the Scriptures from the common people; for we
withhold the Bible from <em>our</em> servants, and keep them in
ignorance of it.” A writer in the Observer, of Charleston,
S. C. says: “I hazard the assertion, that throughout
the bounds of our synod, there are at least one hundred
thousand slaves, speaking the same language as
ourselves, who never <em>heard</em> of the plan of salvation by a
Redeemer.” The reason assigned for these oppressive
laws is, that “teaching slaves to read and write tends
to excite dissatisfaction in their minds,” and to produce
insurrection. In Georgia, a white man is fined five hundred
dollars for teaching a slave or free negro to read or
write; and if a colored man attempts to teach the alphabet
even to his own child, he is liable to be fined or
whipped, according to the discretion of the court. Such
laws are necessary for the preservation of this detestable
system; and while such laws exist, how can the
slaves ever be better fitted for freedom? When the British
government insisted that female slaves should no
longer be flogged naked in the Colonies, the Jamaica
legislature replied, that the practice could not possibly
be laid aside, “<em>until</em> the negro women acquired more of
the sense of shame, which distinguishes European females.”
Fitting men for freedom by keeping them
slaves, is like the Jamaica mode of making women modest
by whipping them without clothing.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But don’t you think it would be dangerous to turn
the slaves at once loose upon the community?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The abolitionists never desired to have them turned
loose. They wish to have them governed by salutary
laws, so regulated as effectually to protect both
master and slave. They merely wish to have the power
of punishment transferred from individuals to magistrates;
to have the sale of human beings cease; and to
have the stimulus of <em>wages</em> applied, instead of the stimulus
of the <em>whip</em>. The relation of master and laborer
might still continue; but under circumstances less irksome
and degrading to both parties. Even that much
abused animal the jackass can be made to travel more
expeditiously by suspending a bunch of turnips on a pole
and keeping them before his nose, than he can by the
continual application of the whip; and even when human
beings are brutalized to the last degree, by the
soul-destroying system of slavery, they have still sense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
enough left to be more willing to work two hours for
twelve cents, than to work one hour for nothing.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> I should think this system, in the long run, must
be an unprofitable one.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is admitted to be so. Southerners often declare
that it takes six slaves to do what is easily performed by
half the number of free laborers. Henry Clay says, “It
is believed that slave-labor would no where be employed
in the farming portions of the United States, if the proprietors
were not tempted to raise slaves by the high
price of the Southern market, which keeps it up in their
own;” and he says the effects of introducing slavery into
Kentucky have been to keep them in the rear of
their non-slave-holding neighbors, in agriculture, manufactures,
and general prosperity. General Washington,
when writing to Sir John Sinclair on the comparative
value of the soil in Pennsylvania and Virginia, ascribes
the very low price of land in Virginia to the existence
of slavery among them. John Randolph declared
that Virginia was so impoverished by slavery, that
slaves would soon be advertising for runaway masters.
A distinguished writer on political economy says: “The
slave system inflicts an incalculable amount of human
suffering, for the sake of making a wholesale waste of
labor and capital.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But the masters say the negroes would cut their
throats, if they were emancipated.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is safer to judge by uniform experience than by
the assertions of the masters, who, even if they have no
intention to deceive, are very liable to be blinded by
having been educated in the midst of a bad system. Listen
to facts on this subject. On the 10th of October,
1811, the Congress of Chili decreed that every child born
after that day should be free. In April, 1812, the government
of Buenos Ayres ordered that every child born
after the 1st of January, 1813, should be free. In 1821,
the Congress of Colombia emancipated all slaves who
had borne arms in favor of the Republic, and provided
for the emancipation, in eighteen years, of the whole
slave population, of 900,000. In September, 1829, the
government of Mexico granted immediate and entire
emancipation to every slave. In all these instances, <em>not
one case of insurrection or of bloodshed has ever been
heard of, as the result of emancipation</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>In St. Domingo no measures were taken gradually to
fit the slaves for freedom. They were suddenly emancipated
during a civil war, and armed against British invaders.
They at once ceased to be property, and were
recognized as human beings. Col. Malefant, who resided
on the island, informs us, in his Historical and Political
History of the Colonies, that, “after this public
act of emancipation, the negroes remained quiet both
in the south and west, and they continued to work upon
all the plantations. The colony was flourishing. The
whites lived happily and in peace upon their estates,
and the negroes continued to work for them.” General
Lacroix, in his Memoirs of St. Domingo, speaking of the
same period, says: “The colony marched as by enchantment
towards its ancient splendor; cultivation
prospered; every day produced perceptible proofs of its
progress.” This prosperous state of things lasted about
eight years, and would perhaps have continued to the
present day, had not Bonaparte, at the instigation of the
old French planters, sent an army to deprive the blacks
of the freedom they had used so well. The enemies of
abolition are always talking of the horrors of St. Domingo,
as an argument to prove that emancipation is dangerous;
but historical facts prove that the effort to <em>restore
slavery</em> occasioned all the bloodshed in that island;
while <em>emancipation produced only the most peaceful and
prosperous results</em>.</p>

<p>In June, 1794, Victor Hugo, a French republican
general, retook Guadaloupe from the British, and immediately
proclaimed freedom to all the slaves. They
were 85,000 in number, and the whites only 13,000. <em>No
disasters occurred in consequence of this step.</em> More than
seven years after this, the Supreme Council of Guadaloupe,
in an official document, alluding to the tranquillity
which reigned throughout the island, observed: “We
shall have the satisfaction of having given an example,
which will prove that <em>all classes of people may live in perfect
harmony with each other, under an administration which
secures justice to all classes</em>.” In 1802, Bonaparte sent
a powerful French force, and again reduced the island
to slavery, at the cost of about 20,000 negro lives.</p>

<p>In July, 1828, thirty thousand Hottentots in Cape
Colony were emancipated from their long and cruel
bondage, and admitted by law to all the rights and privileges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
of the white colonists. Outrages were predicted,
as the inevitable consequence of freeing human creatures
so completely brutalized as the poor Hottentots;
but all went on peaceably; and, as a gentleman facetiously
remarked, “Hottentots as they were, they
worked much better for Mr. <em>Cash</em>, than they had ever
done for Mr. <em>Lash</em>.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But they say the British have had difficulties in
their West Indies.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The enemies of the cause have tried very hard to
get up a “raw-head and bloody-bones” story; but even
if you take their own accounts, you will find that they
have not been able to adduce any instances of violence
in support of their assertions. The real facts are these:
The measure was not carried in a manner entirely satisfactory
to the English abolitionists. Their knowledge
of human nature, combined with the practical evidence
afforded by history, led them to conclude that immediate
and unqualified emancipation was <em>safest</em> for the master,
as well as just to the slave; but the planters raised such
a hue and cry concerning bloodshed and insurrection,
that the British government determined to conciliate
them by a gradual abolition of slavery. It was ordained
that the slaves should work six years longer without
wages, under the name of <em>apprentices</em>; but no punishment
could be inflicted without the special order of magistrates.
The colonies had a right to dispense with the
apprenticeship system if they pleased; but out of the
seventeen West India colonies, Antigua and Bermuda
were the only ones that chose to do so. The act of
Parliament provided that each apprentice should work
for his master <em>forty and a half</em> hours a week, and have
the rest of the time to himself. The masters were not
satisfied with this; and they tried, by a series of petty
vexations, to coerce the apprentices into individual contracts
to work <em>fifty</em> hours in a week. While the people
had been slaves, they were always allowed <em>cooks</em> to prepare
their meals, a person to bring <em>water</em> to the gang
during the hot hours, and <em>nurses</em> to tend the little children
while their mothers were at work in the field; but
because the Abolition Act did not expressly provide that
these privileges should be continued, the masters saw
fit to take them away. Each apprentice was obliged to
quit his or her work, and go, sometimes a great distance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
to the cabin to cook his meals, instead of having
it served up in the field; and the time taken up in this
operation was to be made up out of the apprentices’ own
time. No water was allowed to be brought to quench
their thirst; the aged and infirm, instead of being left,
as formerly, to superintend the children under the shade,
were ordered out into the burning fields; and mothers
were obliged to toil at the hoe with their infants strapped
at their backs. In addition to all these annoyances,
the planters obtained a new proclamation from the governor,
by which they were authorized to require extra
labor of the apprentices in times of emergency, or <em>whenever
they should deem it necessary</em>, in the cultivation,
gathering, or manufacture of the crop, provided they
repaid them an equal time at <em>a convenient season of the
year</em>. This was very much like taking from a New England
laborer the month of July, and paying it back to
him in January. The negroes had behaved extremely
well when emancipation was first proclaimed, and universally
showed a disposition to be orderly, submissive,
and thankful; but this system of privation and injustice
soon created discontent. They knew that they were to
receive no wages, however industrious they might be;
and they were well aware that their masters no longer
had a right to flog them. A bad stimulus to labor had
been removed, without supplying a good one in its place.
In three of the colonies, the apprentices refused to
work on the terms required by their masters. In Jamaica,
a very small military force was sent into one parish,
and only on one occasion; but no violence was offered
on either side; for the apprentices confined themselves
to <em>passive resistance</em>—merely refusing to work on the
required terms. In St. Christophers, difficulties of a
similar kind occurred; but no outrage of any kind was
committed. In one fortnight all the trouble was at an
end; and out of twenty thousand apprentices, only thirty
were found to be absent from their work; and some of
these were supposed to be dead in the woods. In Demarara,
the principal difficulty occurred. The laborers
assembled together, and marched round with a flag staff;
but the <em>worst</em> thing they did was to beat a constable with
their fists. <em>It is a solemn fact that a few fisty cuffs with
a constable are the only violence to persons or property,
that has been attempted by the eight hundred thousand
slaves emancipated in the British Colonies!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>Even the difficulties above enumerated (slight as they
were, and unworthy to be named in connexion with such
a great moral change) were but temporary. The governor
of Jamaica, after five months’ trial of emancipation,
declares, in his address to the Assembly, “Not
the slightest idea of any interruption of tranquillity exists
in any quarter; and those preparations which I have
felt it my duty to make, might, without the slightest
danger, have been dispensed with.” By recent news,
we learn that the planters finding the system of coercion
was likely to be ruinous to their own interest,
offered the apprentices 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per day for extra work.
The enemies of abolition prophesied that nothing would
induce the negroes to work more than they were actually
compelled to by law, and that the crops would perish
for want of gathering. But the result proved otherwise.
As soon as <em>wages</em> were offered, they came forward
eagerly, and offered to do more work than the planters
were willing to pay for. We have the testimony of one
of their magistrates, that as soon as this system was
tried, “their apparent indifference was every where
thrown off, and their work carried on in a steady, persevering,
and diligent manner.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> And how was it in Antigua and Bermuda, where
they gave up the apprenticeship system, and tried immediate
and unqualified emancipation?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> In those colonies not the slightest difficulty, of any
kind, has occurred. The Antigua journals declare,
“The great doubt is solved; the highest hopes of the
negroes’ friends are fulfilled. A whole people, comprising
thirty thousand souls, have passed from slavery
into freedom, not only without the slightest irregularity,
but with the solemn and decorous tranquillity of a Sabbath.”
The Christmas holidays were always seasons
of alarm in the slave-colonies, and a military force was
always held in readiness; but the Christmas after emancipation,
the customary guard was dispensed with. Up
to the present time, every thing remains perfectly tranquil
in Antigua; and a negro is at the head of the police
in that island. The population consists of 2,000 whites,
30,000 slaves, and 4,500 free blacks.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Yet people are always saying that free negroes
cannot take care of themselves.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is because people are either very much prejudiced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
or very ignorant on the subject. In the United
States, colored persons have scarcely any chance to
rise. They are despised, and abused, and discouraged,
at every turn. In the slave States they are subject to
laws nearly as oppressive as those of the slave. They
are whipped or imprisoned, if they try to learn to read
or write; they are not allowed to testify in court; and
there is a general disposition not to encourage them
by giving them employment. In addition to this,
the planters are very desirous to expel them from
the State, partly because they are jealous of their influence
upon the slaves, and partly because those who
have slaves to let out, naturally dislike the competition
of the free negroes. But if colored people are well
treated, and have the same inducements to industry as
other people, they work as well and behave as well.
A few years ago the Pennsylvanians were very much
alarmed at the representations that were made of the
increase of pauperism from the ingress of free negroes.
A committee was appointed to examine into the subject,
and it was ascertained that the colored people not only
supported their own poor, but paid a considerable additional
sum towards the support of white paupers.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> I have heard people say that the slaves would not
take their freedom, if it were offered to them.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I sincerely wish they would offer it. I should like
to see the experiment tried. If the slaves are so well
satisfied with their condition, why do they make such
severe laws against running away? Why are the patroles
on duty all the time to shoot every negro who
does not give an account of himself as soon as they call
to him? Why, notwithstanding all these pains and penalties,
are their newspapers full of advertisements for
runaway slaves? If the free negroes are so much worse
off than those in bondage, why is it that their laws bestow
freedom on any slave, “who saves his master or
mistress’s life, or performs any meritorious service to
the State?” That must be a very bad country where
the law stipulates that <em>meritorious</em> actions shall be rewarded
by making a man more unhappy than he was
before! Some months ago, I had a conversation with a
woman, who went from Boston to Tuscaloosa, in Alabama.
She was the wife of a Baptist clergyman, professed
to be a pious woman, and was considered as such.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
I found her an apologist for slavery, but was not aware
at the time that she actually owned slaves. She maintained
that freedom was the greatest curse that could be
bestowed on a slave; and when I attempted to put the
case home to her conscience, she, for consistency’s sake,
declared, that she should be quite as willing to die and
leave her own little son in slavery, as to leave him a free
laborer at the North. She said if she had a hundred
slaves, she should treat them all kindly, and endeavor to
make their condition comfortable. I replied, “I am
willing to believe that you would do so, madam; but in
case of your death, or of any pecuniary distress in the
family, the poor slaves would be divided among heirs, or
seized by creditors; and then who can tell into whose
hands they may fall? The condition of the slave depends
on the character of the master; and that is entirely a
matter of <em>accident</em>”. The pious woman rejoined, “Oh, I
should take care of that. If they were good, faithful
servants, they would find at my death that papers of
manumission had been duly prepared.” “But you told
me that freedom was the greatest curse that could be
bestowed upon a slave,” replied I: “Now is it possible,
madam, that you would leave, as your dying legacy to
good and faithful servants, the greatest curse you could
bestow?”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Do you suppose they really believe what they say,
when they declare that slaves are happier than freemen?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I leave your own republican good sense to determine
that question. Governor Giles of Virginia did not
take that ground in his address to the Legislature in
1827. Speaking of punishing free blacks by selling
them as slaves, he says: “Slavery must be admitted to
be a punishment of the highest order; and according to
every just rule for the apportionment of punishment to
crimes, it would seem that <em>it ought to be applied only to
crime of the highest order</em>!”</p>

<p>But even if it were true that the slaves were as happy
and contented as slave-holders try to represent them—what
would it prove? It would merely prove that they
had fearfully brutalized immortal souls before they <em>could</em>
be happy in such a situation. Edmund Burke said very
truly, “If you have made a <em>happy slave</em>, you have made
a <em>degraded man</em>.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But how is it that some people, who really do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
intend to make false representations, bring back such
favorable accounts of slavery, after they have visited at
the South?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It is because they go among rich, hospitable
planters, and see favorite household slaves. Of the poor
wretches on the plantations, subject to the tender mercies
of an overseer, they know as little, as the guests of
a Russian nobleman know of the miserable condition of
his serfs. Their sympathies all go with the master.
They ask questions of the master, and not of the slave.
Even if they tried to talk with the latter, the poor creatures
would be afraid to speak freely, lest any expressions
of discontent might be reported to the master, or
the overseer. I should like to have you hear them talk
as I have heard runaway slaves talk, when they knew
they had a friend to listen to them!</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But do you think the suitable time has yet come
to exert ourselves on this subject?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I will answer, as a similar question was lately answered
by a lady who had been brought up in the midst
of slavery: “If thou were a slave, toiling in the fields
of Carolina, I apprehend thou wouldst think the time
had <em>fully</em> come.” This explains the whole difficulty.
We do not put ourselves in the condition of the slave,
and imagine what would be our feelings if we were in
<em>his</em> circumstances. We do not obey the Scripture injunction,
“remember those that are in bonds, <em>as bound
with them</em>.”</p>

<p>But if we look at this question merely with a view to
expediency, without reference to justice or mercy, when
can we hope that a time will come <em>more</em> propitious to the
discussion of this subject? The fact is, difficulties and
dangers increase every day. In South Carolina and
Louisiana, the blacks are already a majority. The annual
increase of the <em>slaves</em>, without including the free
blacks, in the United States, is now 62,000 annually. It
is a fact worthy of consideration, that the licentiousness
of the white man increases the colored race; but the
vices of colored men or women can never increase the
white race; for the children of such connections are of
course not white.—These people are increasing in the
midst of us in startling ratio. If we pursue a kind and
Christian course, we can identify their interests with the
rest of the community, and make them our friends; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
if we persevere in the course we have pursued, their
feelings and interests <em>must</em> be all in opposition to ours,
and there is great reason to fear the consequences.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Don’t you think the Colonization Society is doing
some good?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Those who have examined into the subject, have so
universally come to the conclusion that Colonization is
entirely ineffectual for the abolition of slavery at any
time, however remote, that it seems hardly worth while
to waste words on that subject. I do not pretend to impeach
the motives of benevolent individuals, who have
been engaged in it; but there is no doubt that its <em>practical
tendency</em> is to perpetuate slavery. John Randolph,
and other slave-holders, have advocated that Society,
upon the avowed ground that by sending off an inconvenient
surplus it would increase the price of the slaves
left. In the new slave States, where they have not as
yet an “inconvenient surplus” of slaves, they don’t like
the Colonization Society; but the old slave States have
been its warmest friends. There is one brief objection
to the idea of abolishing slavery by Colonization: <em>it is
impossible</em>. Even if it were desirable to remove these
valuable laborers from our soil, it could not be done, if
the whole Treasury and Navy of the United States were
devoted to it. The Colonization Society has been in
operation about nineteen years; they have had immense
funds; and they have transported to Africa, during that
time, about three thousand colored persons, of which
<em>not one thousand</em> were manumitted slaves. Now the annual
<em>increase</em> of the slaves alone is 62,000; and the annual
increase of the free blacks is about 10,000. <em>In
nineteen years the Colonizationists have not been able to
carry off one sixtieth part of the increase of the slaves in
one year!</em> This is worse than the old story of the frog,
who jumped out of the well two feet every night, and
fell back three feet every morning. But even if the
colored people <em>could</em> be all carried out of the country,
what is the South to do for laborers? They have been
in the habit of excusing themselves, by saying that white
men cannot work in their climate, and by taking it for
granted that black men will not work for wages. If the
climate is unsuitable for white laborers, it is manifestly
very impolitic to send off the black ones. It would be
far wiser to try the experiment they have tried in Bermuda<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
and Antigua. Labor is needed in all parts of our
country; and it is worse than a childish game to be
sending off ship-loads of laborers to Africa, while we
are bringing in ship-loads from Ireland, Holland, and
Switzerland.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> I have heard some people say they gave their
money to the Colonization Society merely as a missionary
establishment.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It would be well for those people to examine into
the matter, and first ascertain whether it <em>is</em> a missionary
establishment. When we send missions to India, the
Sandwich Islands, &amp;c., we send men believed to be pious
and enlightened. For the probable influence of the emigrants
carried out by the Colonization Society, let the
Society answer for itself. They assure us that the colored
persons colonized from the United States will
“carry religion and the arts into the heart of Africa.”
Yet Mr. Clay, Vice President of the Society, says, “Of
all classes of our population the most vicious is that of
the free colored—contaminated themselves, they extend
their vices to all around them.” And the African Repository,
which is the organ of the Society, declares that
“they are notoriously ignorant—a curse and a contagion
wherever they reside.” Now, are not these admirable
missionaries to send out to christianize Africa? It
would be wise to put them under better and more encouraging
influences at home, before we attempt to send
them to enlighten heathen lands.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Some say that these people are naturally inferior
to us; and that the shape of their skulls proves it.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> If I believed that the colored people were naturally
inferior to the whites, I should say that was an additional
reason why we ought to protect, instruct, and encourage
them. No consistent republican will say that a
strong-minded man has a right to oppress those less
gifted than himself. Slave-holders do not seem to think
the negroes are so stupid as not to acquire knowledge,
and make use of it, if they could get a chance. If they
do think so, why do their laws impose such heavy penalties
on all who attempt to give them any education?
Nobody thinks it necessary to forbid the promulgation
of knowledge among monkeys. If you believe the colored
race are naturally inferior, I wish you would read
the history of Toussaint L’Ouverture, the Washington<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of St. Domingo. Though perfectly black, he was unquestionably
one of the greatest and best men of his
age. I wish you would hear Mr. Williams of New
York, and Mr. Douglass of Philadelphia preach a few
times, before you hastily decide concerning the capacity
of the colored race for intellectual improvement. As
for the shape of their skulls, I shall be well satisfied if
our Southern brethren will emancipate all the slaves
who have <em>not</em> what is called the “African conformation.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What do you think about property in slaves?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Let me reply to that question by asking others. If
you were taken by an Algerine pirate, and an Arab
bought you, and paid honestly for you, should you ever
consider yourself the <em>property</em> of the Arab? Should you
think your fellow-citizens ought so to consider you?
Can what is stolen in the beginning, be honest property
in the transmission? If you and your children had
toiled hard for years, and received only a peck of corn
a week for your services, should you not think that some
compensation was due to <em>you</em>?</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> These are hard questions; and I find it is hard to
answer a good many things, when we once get into the
habit of imagining how we should think and feel if we
ourselves were the slaves. But what have the North to
do on this subject?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They cannot help having a great deal to do with
it, either for good or for evil. They are citizens of this
republic; and as such cannot but feel a painful interest
in a subject which makes their beloved country an object
of derision to the civilized world. If the slaves should
make any attempt to gain their freedom, we are bound
to go with an armed force and rivet their chains. If a
slave escapes from his master unto us, we are bound to
deliver him up to the lash. The people of Pennsylvania,
living so near the slave States, have a great many of
these painful scenes to encounter. A few months ago,
an industrious and pious colored man in Philadelphia
was torn from his home at midnight, and beaten in such
a degree that the snow for some distance was stained
with his blood. His poor wife, who was devotedly attached
to him, had an infant about eight or ten days old;
but regardless of her situation, she plunged into the
snow, and implored mercy for her husband. Her shrieks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and entreaties were of no avail. The citizens of Philadelphia
could not help her, because the free States are
bound by law to give up runaway slaves. The evil
might be cured by the extreme cheapness of labor, if
the surplus population were not drained off to supply
<em>new</em> slave States. But in order to accommodate slave-holders
in this respect, Louisiana has been bought, and
Florida bought, by revenues principally raised in the
free States; and now they want to purchase Texas likewise
for an eternal slave market. Every time a member
from the free States votes for the admission of a slave
state into the Union, he helps to increase the political
power, which has always been wielded for the perpetuation
of this abominable system. It is high time for the
free States to begin to reflect seriously, whether they
ought any longer to give their money and their moral
influence in support of this iniquity.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> I did not know we were obliged to give up runaway
slaves to their masters. Are you sure it is so?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> When masters <em>bring</em> their slaves into the free
States, or <em>send</em> them, the slaves can legally take their
freedom; but when the slaves run away, we are obliged
by law to give them up, let the circumstances be what
they may. Many conscientious people prefer to obey
the law of God, which says, “Thou shalt not deliver
unto his master the servant which hath escaped unto
thee.”</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But would you at once give so many ignorant
creatures political power, by making them voters?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> That would be for the wisdom of legislators to decide;
and they would probably decide that it would not
be judicious to invest emancipated slaves with the elective
franchise; for though it is not their fault that they
have been kept brutally ignorant, it unfits them for
voters. At the present time, slaves <em>are</em> represented in
Congress. Every five slaves are counted equal to three
freemen; which is just the same as if our farmers were
allowed to count every five of their oxen as three voters.
This system gives the Southern aristocracy great political
power, entirely unchecked by democratic influence,
which comes in as a counterpoise in States where the
laboring class are allowed to vote. W. B. Seabrook, of
South Carolina, has lately published an Essay on the
management of slaves, in which he says: “An addition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
of $1,000,000 to the private fortune of Daniel Webster would
not give to Massachusetts more weight than she now possesses
in the Federal Councils. On the other hand, every increase
of slave property in South Carolina, is a fraction thrown into
the scale by which <em>her representation in Congress is determined</em>.”
This country has been governed by a President forty-eight
years. During forty of those years we have been governed by
a slave-holder! The New England candidates each remained
in office but four years; and the great middle section has never
given a President. The Middle States are politically
stronger than the Northern, and are therefore more likely to
act independently, and without reference to Southern support.
Perhaps this may be the reason why those States, large and
wealthy as they are, have never given a President to their
country. Slave-holders are keen-sighted politicians; and they
are closely knit together by one common bond of sympathy
on the subject of slavery. It is a common remark with them
that they never will vote for any man north of the Potomac.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> You know that abolitionists are universally accused of
wishing to promote the amalgamation of colored and white
people.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> This is a false charge, got up by the enemies of the cause,
and used as a bugbear to increase the prejudices of the community.
By the hue and cry that is raised on the subject, one
would really suppose that in this free country a certain set of
men had power to compel their neighbors to marry contrary
to their own inclination. The abolitionists have never, by example,
writing, or conversation, endeavored to connect amalgamation
with the subject of abolition. When their enemies
insist upon urging this silly and unfounded objection, they
content themselves with replying, “If there be a natural antipathy
between the races, the antipathy will protect itself. If
such marriages are contrary to the order of Providence, we
certainly may trust Providence to take care of the matter. It
is a poor compliment to the white young men to be so afraid
that the moment we allow the colored ones to be educated,
the girls will all be running after them.”</p>

<p>At a town meeting in New Hampshire, one of the citizens
rose to say that he did not approve of admitting colored lads
into the school. “If you suffer these people to be educated,”
said he, “the first thing we shall know they will be marrying
our daughters!” After some other remarks, he concluded by
saying, “it is impossible for the colored and white race to live
together in a kind social relation—there is a natural antipathy—they
cannot be made to mix any better than oil and water.”
A plain farmer replied, “I thought you said just now,
that you was afraid that they’d marry our <em>darters</em>; if they won’t
mix any better than <em>ile</em> and water, what are you afraid of?”
Any one who observes the infinite variety of shadings in the
complexions of the colored people, will perceive that amalgamation
has for a long time been carried on. The only justification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
that the apologist for slavery can give is, that it is not
sanctioned by marriage. According to Southern laws every
child must follow the condition of its <em>mother</em>; that is, if the
mother is a slave, her offspring must be so likewise. If they
would change one word, and say the child shall follow the
condition of its <em>father</em>, a large proportion of their slaves would
be free at once; and the others would soon become so, provided
no new cargoes were in the mean time smuggled in from
Africa. In this subject, the truth is briefly told in a juvenile
couplet, viz.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“By universal emancipation,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We want to <em>stop</em> amalgamation.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is there any truth in the charge that you wish to break
down all distinctions of society, and introduce the negroes into
our parlors?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> There is not the slightest truth in this charge. People
have pointed to an ignorant shoe-black, and asked me whether
I would invite him to visit my house. I answered, “No; I
would not do so if he were a white man; and I should not be
likely to do it, merely because he was black.” An educated
person will not naturally like to associate with one who is
grossly ignorant. It may be no merit in one that he is well-informed,
and no fault of the other that he is ignorant; for
these things may be the result of circumstances, over which
the individual had no control; but such people will not choose
each other’s society merely from want of sympathy. For
these reasons, I would not select an ignorant man, of any
complexion, for my companion; but when you ask me whether
that man’s children shall have as fair a chance as my own, to
obtain an education, and rise in the world, I should be ashamed
of myself, both as a Christian and a republican, if I did not
say, yes, with all my heart.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But do you believe that prejudice against color ever can
be overcome?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, I do; because I have faith that all things will pass
away, which are not founded in reason and justice. In France
and England, this prejudice scarcely exists at all. Their noblemen
would never dream of taking offence because a colored
gentleman sat beside them in a stage-coach, or at the table of
an hotel. Be assured, however, that the abolitionists have not
the slightest wish to force you to give up this prejudice. If,
after conscientious examination, you believe it to be right,
cherish it; but do not adhere to it merely because your neighbors
do. Look it in the face—apply the golden rule—and
judge for yourself. The Mahometans really think they could
not eat at the same table with a Christian, without pollution;
but I have no doubt the time will come when this prejudice
will be removed. The old feudal nobles of England would
not have thought it possible that their descendants could live
in a community, where they and their vassals were on a perfect
civil equality; yet the apparent impossibility has come to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
pass, with advantage to many, and injury to none. When we
endeavor to conform to the spirit of the gospel, there is never
any danger that it will not lead us into the paths of peace.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But they say your measures are unconstitutional.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Is it unconstitutional to talk, and write, and publish on
any subject? particularly one in which the welfare and character
of the country are so deeply involved? This is all the
abolitionists have ever done; it is all they have ever desired
to do. Nobody disputes that Congress has constitutional
power to abolish slavery and the slave-trade in the District of
Columbia. That District belongs in common to all the States,
and each of them has an interest in the slaves there. The
public prisons of that District, built <em>with the money of the whole
people</em> of the United States, are used for the benefit of slave-traders,
and the groaning victims of this detestable traffic are
kept confined within their walls. The keepers of these prisons,
<em>paid with the money of the whole people</em>, act as jailers to these
slave-traders, until their gang of human brutes can be completed.
When we are acting as accomplices in all this, have
we no right to petition for the abolition of slavery and the
slave trade <em>there</em>? I do not see how any conscientious man
can help believing it to be a solemn duty.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is there any truth in the charge, that abolitionists have
tried to excite insurrections among the slaves?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> This charge is destitute of the slightest foundation in
truth. The abolitionists have addressed facts and arguments
to the slave-holders <em>only</em>. They have never sought for any
communication with the slaves; and if they did so, their principles
would lead them to teach patience and submission, until
their deliverance could be accomplished by peaceful
measures. I believe the publications by the Peace Society do
not contain so much in defence of non-resistance under injury,
as the publications of the abolitionists. If it should be discovered
that any member of an Anti-Slavery Society had tried
to excite disaffection among the slaves, he would be immediately
turned out of the Society, with strong expressions of
disapprobation. This false charge has been got up at the
South merely to excite sympathy. A little while ago a paragraph
went the rounds of the newspapers, concerning an <em>abolitionist</em>
who had been overheard trying to persuade a negro
lad to run away, and offering to forge free papers for him. It
was afterwards ascertained that the man was a <em>kidnapper</em>, and
took this means of getting the boy into his own power, for the
sake of selling him. Complaints are made that pictures of a
man flogging slaves having been on some of the books sent to
the South; and it is urged that negroes can understand these
pictures, if they do not know their letters. In the first place,
the books are sent to the masters. In the next place (as has
been well observed), the pictures represent a thing that is
either true, or not true. If it is not true, the negroes would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
look at the picture without being reminded of any thing <em>they</em>
had ever seen or known—if told that it represented a driver
beating slaves, they would laugh at such Munchausen stories
of things that never happened. On the other hand, if the representation
is true, would the mere picture of a thing be more
likely to excite them to insurrection than the thing itself?
These stories of efforts to excite violence are mere spectres
raised on purpose for the occasion. If you will take notice of
the charges brought against abolitionists, you will find that
they are always mere assertions, unsupported by quotations,
or any species of evidence. When I have read the resolutions
passed at public meetings against the abolitionists, I have
smiled at the farce which those men have been acting. In
nearly all their resolutions, the abolitionists could most cordially
and conscientiously concur. The enemies of the cause
have in several cities gravely met together to declare that they
do not approve of attempts to promote insurrections. The
abolitionists agree with them entirely. With the same ridiculous
gravity, they make known to the world that they do not
approve of any legislative interference with the Southern
States. The abolitionists have never dreamed of any such interference.
They merely wish to <em>induce the Southerners to
legislate for themselves</em>; and they hope to do this by the universal
dissemination of facts and arguments, calculated to promote
a <em>correct public sentiment</em> on the subject of slavery. This is all
they ever intended to do; and this they will do, though earth
and hell combine against their efforts. The men engaged in
this cause are not working for themselves, but for God—and
therefore they are strong.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But do you believe the Southerners ever can be persuaded?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> At all events, it is our duty to try. “Thus saith the Lord
God, Thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they
will hear, or whether they will forbear; neither be afraid of
their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and
thou dost dwell among scorpions.” If public sentiment becomes
universally reformed on this subject, it cannot fail to
have a powerful influence. Slavery was abolished in the British
dominions entirely by moral influence. Parliament never
would have voted for the bill, the king never would have
signed it, if an enlightened public sentiment had not made the
step absolutely necessary; and the public became enlightened
by the exertions of benevolent men, who were obliged to endure
every form of obloquy and rage, before the good work
was completed. The slave-holders are perfectly aware that
the same causes will produce similar effects in this country.
One of the Southern editors has lately declared that what is
most to be feared is, that these fanatical abolitionists will make
some people of morbid consciences believe that slavery really
<em>is</em> wrong, and that it is their duty to relinquish it. Another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Southern newspaper complains that the worst effect of this
discussion is, that it is causing good men to regard slave-holders
with abhorrence.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But if the system works so badly in every respect, why
are people so unwilling to give it up?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Human nature is willing to endure much, rather than relinquish
unbridled licentiousness and despotic control. The
emperor of Russia, and the pachas of Egypt would be reluctant
to abridge their own power, for the sake of introducing a
system of things more conducive to the freedom, virtue and
happiness of their subjects. They had rather live in constant
fear of the poisoned bowl and the midnight dagger, than to
give up the pleasant exercise of tyranny, to which they have
so long been accustomed. In addition to this feeling, so common
to our nature, there are many conscientious people, who
are terrified at the idea of emancipation. It has always been
presented to them in the most frightful colors; and bad men
are determined, if possible, to prevent the abolitionists from
proving to such minds that <em>the dangers of insurrection all belong
to slavery, and would cease when slavery was abolished</em>.</p>

<p>At the North, the apologists of slavery are numerous and
virulent, because their <em>interests</em> are closely intertwined with
the pernicious system. Inquire into the private history of
many of the men, who have called meetings against the abolitionists—you
will find that some manufacture negro cloths
for the South—some have sons who sell those cloths—some
have daughters married to slave-holders—some have plantations
and slaves mortgaged to them—some have ships employed
in Southern commerce—and some candidates for political
offices would bow until their back-bones were broken,
to obtain or preserve Southern influence. The Southerners
understand all this perfectly well, and despise our servility,
even while they condescend to make use of it.</p>

<p>One great reason why the people of this country have not
thought and felt right on this subject, is that all our books,
newspapers, almanacs and periodicals, have combined to represent
the colored race as an inferior and degraded class, who
never could be made good and useful citizens. Ridicule and
reproach have been abundantly heaped upon them; but their
virtues and their sufferings have found few historians. The
South has been well satisfied with such a public sentiment.
It sends back no echo to disturb their consciences, and it effectually
rivets the chain on the necks of their vassals. In this
department of service, the Colonization Society has been a
most active and zealous agent.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But some people say that all the mobs, and other violent
proceedings, are to be attributed to the abolitionists.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> They might as well charge the same upon St. Paul, when
his fearless preaching of the gospel brought him into such
imminent peril, that his friends were obliged to “let him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
down over the wall in a basket,” to save his life. As well
might St. Stephen have been blamed for the mob that stoned
him to death. With the same justice might William Penn
have been called the cause of all the violent persecutions
against the Quakers. When principles of truth are sent out
in the midst of a perverse generation, they <em>always</em> come
“<ins class="corr" id="tn-36" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'not not to bring peace'">
not to bring peace</ins>, but a sword.” The abolitionists have offered
violence to no man—they have never attempted to stop
the discussions of their opponents; but have, on the contrary,
exerted themselves to obtain a candid examination of the subject
on all sides. They merely claim the privilege of delivering
peaceful addresses at orderly meetings, and of publishing
what they believe to be facts, with an honest desire to have
them tested by the strictest ordeal of truth.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But do you think a foreigner ought to be allowed to lecture
on this subject?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> <em>We</em> have some hundred missionaries abroad lecturing
other nations—preaching against systems most closely entwined
with the government and prejudices of the people. If
good and conscientious men leave ease, honor, and popularity
behind them, to come here, and labor among the poor
and the despised, merely from zeal in a good cause, shall we
refuse to hear what they have to say? If we insult, mob, and
stone them, how could we consistently blame the Hindoos and
Sandwich Islanders for abusing <em>our</em> missionaries? We sent
out agents to England, to give her the benefit of our experience
on the subject of temperance; ought <em>we</em> not to be willing to
receive the benefit of her experience on the subject of slavery?
Let us candidly hear what these men have to say. If it be
contrary to reason and truth, reject it; if it be the truth, let us
ponder it in our hearts.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But everybody says the discussion of slavery will lead to
the dissolution of the Union.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> There must be something wrong in the Union, if the
candid discussion of <em>any</em> subject can dissolve it; and for the
truth of this remark, I appeal to your own good sense. If the
South should be injudicious enough to withdraw from the
Union for the sake of preserving a moral pestilence in her
borders, it is very certain that slavery cannot long continue after
that event. None of the frontier States could long keep their
slaves, if we were not obliged by law to deliver up runaways;
nor could they any longer rely upon the free States, in cases
of emergency, to support slavery by force of arms. The union
of these States has been continually disturbed and embittered
by the existence of slavery; and the abolitionists would fain
convince the whole country that it is best to cast away this
apple of discord. Their attachment to the Union is so strong,
that they would make any sacrifice of self-interest to preserve
it; but they never will consent to sacrifice honor and principle.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
